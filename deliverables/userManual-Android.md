The bar contains 5 buttons to navigate through "Home Page", "Search Page", "Create Path Page", "Activities Page" and "Profile Page" respectively. This bar is always available to guide users in the application.

"New" segment consists of recently created paths and recently used tags.

## Topic Page - Path Page:

Via tapping on paths and tags, users are able to navigate through corresponding Topic's Page or Learning Path's Page. Also the hearth button next to each path gives the opportunity to favorite paths. Two examples of Topic page and Learning Path page is as follows. 

<img width="220" alt="Topic page" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36928191/149167750-576a4604-106c-45b8-bff2-54a00ca7e701.png"> <img width="220" alt="Path" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36928191/149167799-7417520f-b733-4d4e-9f7a-e095c361e70e.png"> <img width="220" alt="Path resource" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36928191/149167850-4c3aa0e8-3cd4-4aaa-8350-cfe878339e5b.png">

In. addition to those, the related topics and related paths are available to discover. Again, navigation to the paths or topics page via tapping is provided.
To navigate back to the Home Page, the back button at the left end of the header should be used.

The fifth option on the navigation bar is profile page. Here we can see some statistic about user like the number of favorites paths, enrolled paths and paths that are done next to the profile page at the top of the page. The about part follows a refresh button which refreshes the stats about users.
